# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this project is to help a large technology company prepare for a large number of employees expected to retire. By constructing an employee database using SQL, I conducted several queries to find out which departments will be losing which employees and when. The hope is to get ahead of the curve and know which departments will lose who in order to hire their replacements.

Additionally, the company is considering a mentorship program for employees who are eligible to retire. This mentorship program would allow retirement-eligible employees to transition to a part-time position rather than completely retiring. 


## Results:
* Retiring Employees
  * We narrowed down the ages of the expected retirees to be born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. This yielded a number of 72,458 employees.
  * Of these employees, 7 job titles are affected. The two most affected with upcoming retirement are Senior Engineer and Staff Engineer.

* Mentorship Program
  * As mentioned, the suggested mentorship program will give upcoming retirees the ability to work part-time and help train incoming replacements. However, of the 72,458 employees expected to retired in the next four years, only 1,549 employees meet the criteria to apply for the mentorship program.

  * This is likely to cause some problems to productivity if jobs are not replaced at an equal rate of those retiring.

## Summary:
The number of employees expected to retire will cause huge distruptions to the Pewlett Hackard workforce. Even wtih the mentorship program, the eligibility is not large enough to cover the large exodus from the company. As of now, the eligibility for the mentorship program is only for those born in 1965. If this is widened to cover a larger time frame, say 1965 to 1970, then this could allow more flexibility and room for advancement.

There may not be enough job seekers to cover the large number of expected retirees in the next few years. However, the sooner the replacement hiring process can begin, coupled with widening the years of eligible mentors and restructuring some of the current jobs, then it may be possible to mitigate some of the expected production losses expected to come.
